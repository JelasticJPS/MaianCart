# Maian Cart

The package deploys the [Maian Cart](https://www.maiancart.com/) solution - a solid self-hosted platform to sell your products. Maian Cart is a comprehensive e-commerce solution designed to help businesses create and manage online stores with ease. It offers a wide range of features, including product management, order processing, customer management, and various payment gateway integrations.


## Environment Topology

This package creates a dedicated Maian Cart environment that contains one application server and one database container. It automatically deploys and sets the Maian Cart application. The automatic vertical scaling is enabled out of the box, and [horizontal scaling](https://www.virtuozzo.com/application-platform-docs/automatic-horizontal-scaling/) can be configured (if needed). The default software stacks utilized in the package are the following:

- Apache 2 PHP application server (PHP 8.1)
- MariaDB 10 database
- Maian Cart 3.8
